            hard

          <h4>
            I was surprised at the way my stress about starting school started to disappear toward the end of the first
            week.
            I found myself excited to work on my daily projects especially at home. The start of this week I was feeling
            more
            confident, and then almost instantly felt like I was at the bottom of a very long staircase that seemed to
            go
            on
            forever. The overwhelming feeling that i had the first week was back and the doubts started to flood
            in.."what
            was
            I thinking I cant do this","Im so far behind,how will I ever catch up", "I cant ask a question cause I dont
            know
            what to ask but I feel completly lost." On and on my head was filled with self doubt. Luckily I am a
            stubborn
            person and know that I will not be giving up, but that stubborness also hurts me at times when I become to
            proud
            or afraid to ask for help. I know that I have a better understanding than I did at the begining of the week.
            That
            understanding is small, but growing.
            I knew coming into this I would be destroying my comfort zone. I just did have a full understanding at how
            hard
            that was going to be. I have never felt successful in school, and was teased alot for not understanding not
            just
            by students but mostly teachers. Im grateful for the instructors and staff here who want to see you
            successed
            and
            never put you down for what you dont understand.
            The only person standing in my way is me. My goals for this upcoming week is the learn to believe in myself,
            ask
            questions, and simply do the best I can.

          <h4>
            Well the expected happened and our course has officially gone remote. Covid-19 has won and now my school
            went from super freaking hard to super duper freaking hard. I have the hardest time following along in
            lecture being at home. Kids are yelling, my brain wants to go sleep, and every other second I feel like I
            need a snack. This last week destroyed my brain cells. I finished my project and I was able to do pretty
            much all of it on my own, But I seriously have no idea what I did. Jake said that I know more that I
            realize. I say "false"! All trial and error and then all of a sudden it would work and I had no clue how. I
            did realize that Im terrible at naming things. NAMING CONVENTIONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. Most of my mess ups/
            entirely lost I believe were from being mislead by past me. So something I will being working on is making
            sure that I make smart decisions when naming stuff. I cant believe that we are already in week 4. Time has
            gone by so fast and I can tell that I know way more now than I did at the begining. Im excited for future me
            and to feel way more lost and accomplished than I ever have.
            New week, New frustrations, New progress.
