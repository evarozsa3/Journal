  <h1>ENTRY ONE</h1>

    <h3>I was very nervous to start school. I know I struggle with remembering things, and i have to work extra hard
      tofocus. I can be forgetful. I believe that i can overcome that as i get more sleep and i adjust to not being a
      fulltime mom.</h3>

    <h3>
      I was surprised at the way my stress about starting school started to disappear toward the end of the first week.
      I found myself excited to work on my daily projects especially at home. The start of this week I was feeling more
      confident, and then almost instantly felt like I was at the bottom of a very long staircase that seemed to go on
      forever. The overwhelming feeling that i had the first week was back and the doubts started to flood in.."what was
      I thinking I cant do this","Im so far behind,how will I ever catch up", "I cant ask a question cause I dont know
      what to ask but I feel completly lost." On and on my head was filled with self doubt. Luckily I am a stubborn
      person and know that I will not be giving up, but that stubborness also hurts me at times when I become to proud
      or afraid to ask for help. I know that I have a better understanding than I did at the begining of the week. That
      understanding is small, but growing.
      I knew coming into this I would be destroying my comfort zone. I just did have a full understanding at how hard
      that was going to be. I have never felt successful in school, and was teased alot for not understanding not just
      by students but mostly teachers. Im grateful for the instructors and staff here who want to see you successed and
      never put you down for what you dont understand.
      The only person standing in my way is me. My goals for this upcoming week is the learn to believe in myself, ask
      questions, and simply do the best I can.
    </h3>
